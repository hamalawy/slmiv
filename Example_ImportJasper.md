|  Jasper's imagelog contains three image associations. **Dice** is associated with a local image in the image folder.  **Fast Fly Cape** is associated with a url, which was also downloaded to the image folder. Its UUID is the filename and all images are saved as .bmp files.  **Light eyes** is also associated with a local image in the image folder.|![http://joeswammi.com/sl/se/slmyinventory/jasperimages.jpg](http://joeswammi.com/sl/se/slmyinventory/jasperimages.jpg)|
