# How Do I Troubleshoot My Connection to SL using SLMIV? #

Sometimes you may receive an error message or hang when you attempt to connect to Second Life Grid or Custom Grids.  SLMIV tries to log as much as possible for you located in TWO locations. Use #2 if your SLMIV application gets frozen.

  1. Logs tab -> SL Connect Log (shown below)
  1. The same output is found in a text file which is typically located in the SLMIV folder [slconnectlog.txt].

Also, the connection starts having problems when there are issues with the SL Servers themselves. The SL Grid Status is located on the SL Connection tab. Try connecting again when SL states that the regions are cleared up and you are able to login properly with the regular viewer.

```
Q: Where can I find the SLMIV folder on my hard drive?
A: Where USERNAME = Windows username
-Windows XP:	C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\My Documents\SLMIV
-Windows Vista:	C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\SLMIV
-Windows 7:	C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\SLMIV
```
